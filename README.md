Below you can find a summary of each supported type and a brief description of
its intended behavior. For full details about each provider, properties,
parameters, usage and examples please visit its respective Puppet module project
page.


### Google Compute Engine
Detailed information can be found at the
[google-gcompute][] project home page.
The list below is a summary of the supported types by the module:


- `gcompute_address`
  Represents an Address resource.
  Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
  optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
  the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
  communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
  you must specify the instance's external IP address.
  Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
  the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
  the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
  Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
  static.

- `gcompute_backend_bucket`
  Backend buckets allow you to use Google Cloud Storage buckets with HTTP(S)
  load balancing.
  An HTTP(S) load balancing can direct traffic to specified URLs to a
  backend bucket rather than a backend service. It can send requests for
  static content to a Cloud Storage bucket and requests for dynamic content
  a virtual machine instance.

- `gcompute_backend_service`
  Creates a BackendService resource in the specified project using the data
  included in the request.

- `gcompute_disk_type`
  Represents a DiskType resource. A DiskType resource represents the type
  of disk to use, such as a pd-ssd or pd-standard. To reference a disk
  type, use the disk type's full or partial URL.

- `gcompute_disk`
  Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
  the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
  hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
  performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
  hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
  Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
  instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
  even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
  automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
  or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
  storage space requirements.
  Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
  affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

- `gcompute_firewall`
  Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
  instances.
  All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the
  firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it.
  The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are
  shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has
  automatically created firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for
  outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all
  networks except the default network, you must create any firewall rules
  you need.

- `gcompute_global_address`
  Represents a Global Address resource. Global addresses are used for
  HTTP(S) load balancing.

- `gcompute_http_health_check`
  An HttpHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
  individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTP.

- `gcompute_https_health_check`
  An HttpsHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
  individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTPS.

- `gcompute_health_check`
  An HealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
  individual virtual machines should be checked for health, via one of the
  supported protocols.

- `gcompute_license`
  A License resource represents a software license. Licenses are used to
  track software usage in images, persistent disks, snapshots, and virtual
  machine instances.

- `gcompute_image`
  Represents an Image resource.
  Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root
  persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create
  an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
  root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
  running containers on Compute Engine.
  Images can be either public or custom.
  Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
  communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
  access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
  images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
  from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
  to create an instance.

- `gcompute_instance`
  An instance is a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Google's infrastructure.

- `gcompute_instance_group`
  Represents an Instance Group resource. Instance groups are self-managed
  and can contain identical or different instances. Instance groups do not
  use an instance template. Unlike managed instance groups, you must create
  and add instances to an instance group manually.

- `gcompute_network`
  Represents a Network resource.
  Your Cloud Platform Console project can contain multiple networks, and
  each network can have multiple instances attached to it. A network allows
  you to define a gateway IP and the network range for the instances
  attached to that network. Every project is provided with a default network
  with preset configurations and firewall rules. You can choose to customize
  the default network by adding or removing rules, or you can create new
  networks in that project. Generally, most users only need one network,
  although you can have up to five networks per project by default.
  A network belongs to only one project, and each instance can only belong
  to one network. All Compute Engine networks use the IPv4 protocol. Compute
  Engine currently does not support IPv6. However, Google is a major
  advocate of IPv6 and it is an important future direction.

- `gcompute_region`
  Represents a Region resource. A region is a specific geographical
  location where you can run your resources. Each region has one or more
  zones

- `gcompute_route`
  Represents a Route resource.
  A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
  the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
  and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
  routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
  searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
  route.
  Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
  specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
  the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
  uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
  remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
  the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
  machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
  Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
  sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.
  A Routes resources must have exactly one specification of either
  nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, or nextHopVpnTunnel.

- `gcompute_ssl_certificate`
  An SslCertificate resource. This resource provides a mechanism to upload
  an SSL key and certificate to the load balancer to serve secure
  connections from the user.

- `gcompute_subnetwork`
  A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
  that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
  provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
  instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
  other network-related resources.
  Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
  global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
  instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
  private IP addresses.
  Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
  within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
  a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
  space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
  When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
  instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.
  Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
  instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
  region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
  of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.

### Google Cloud DNS
Detailed information can be found at the
[google-gdns][] project home page.
The list below is a summary of the supported types by the module:


- `gdns_managed_zone`
  A zone is a subtree of the DNS namespace under one administrative
  responsibility. A ManagedZone is a resource that represents a DNS zone
  hosted by the Cloud DNS service.

- `gdns_project`
  A project resource. The project is a top level container for resources
  including Cloud DNS ManagedZones.

- `gdns_resource_record_set`
  A unit of data that will be returned by the DNS servers.

### Google Cloud SQL
Detailed information can be found at the
[google-gsql][] project home page.
The list below is a summary of the supported types by the module:


- `gsql_instance`
  Represents a Cloud SQL instance. Cloud SQL instances are SQL databases
  hosted in Google's cloud. The Instances resource provides methods for
  common configuration and management tasks.

- `gsql_database`
  Represents a SQL database inside the Cloud SQL instance, hosted in
  Google's cloud.

- `gsql_user`
  The Users resource represents a database user in a Cloud SQL instance.

- `gsql_ssl_cert`
  Represents an SSL certificate created for a Cloud SQL instance. To use the
  SSL certificate you must have the SSL Client Certificate and the
  associated SSL Client Key. The Client Key can be downloaded only when the
  SSL certificate is created with the insert method.

- `gsql_flag`
  Represents a flag that can be configured for a Cloud SQL instance.

- `gsql_tier`
  The Tiers resource represents a service configuration that can be used to
  define a Cloud SQL instance. Each tier has an associated RAM, maximum
  storage, and list of regions in which the tier can be used. Available
  tiers vary depending on whether you use PostgreSQL, MySQL Second
  Generation, or MySQL First Generation instances.

### Google Compute Storage
Detailed information can be found at the
[google-gstorage][] project home page.
The list below is a summary of the supported types by the module:


- `gstorage_bucket`
  The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There is
  a single global namespace shared by all buckets. For more information, see
  Bucket Name Requirements.
  Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods. In
  addition to the acl property, buckets contain bucketAccessControls, for
  use in fine-grained manipulation of an existing bucket's access controls.
  A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group.

- `gstorage_bucket_access_control`
  The BucketAccessControls resource represents the Access Control Lists
  (ACLs) for buckets within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify who
  has access to your data and to what extent.
  There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:
  READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned, and
  list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
  objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
  WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket,
  and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
  information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
  READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.

### Google Container Engine
Detailed information can be found at the
[google-gcontainer][] project home page.
The list below is a summary of the supported types by the module:


- `gcontainer_cluster`
  A Google Container Engine cluster.

- `gcontainer_node_pool`
  NodePool contains the name and configuration for a cluster's node pool.
  Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM's), with a common configuration and
  specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a
  set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference
  them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to
  accommodate the workload.

### Google Authentication

This module provides the types to authenticate with Google Cloud Platform.  When
executing operations on Google Cloud Platform, e.g. creating a virtual machine,
a SQL database, etc., you need to be authenticated to be able to carry on with
the request.  All Google Cloud Platform modules use an unified authentication
mechanism, provided by this module.

For examples, installation and usage visit the [google-gauth][] module home
page.
